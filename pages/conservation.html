    <h1 style="font-family: Tahoma; font-weight: bold; font-size: large; color: #A4A617;">CONSERVATION</h1>
    <p>Culture and traditions of Sri Lankans are foster by the Biodiversity adding countless value for them. 
      The country has the tradition of Biodiversity Conservation ever since the King Devanampiyatissa in 7th century BC. 
      He declared the first sanctuary in Mihinthale, which is also the first of sanctuary in the world.
    <br>
  <br>
<p>As I suggest the best method for conservation of Sri Lankan bio diversity EASL are…  <a>more>>> </a></p>

<h4 style="font-family: Tahoma; font-weight: bold; font-size: small; color: #A4A617;">How to sustain the sustainability? a look towards Sri Lanka ... </h4>

<p>
Although our ancestors lived in the forest, now we are outsiders to the forest. We live in cities and we try to implement our theoretical 
or less-intense practical knowledge of conservation (we may call it as conservation) in a forest about 100 miles far away. Nevertheless,
 we must understand that these forests, trees, animals and water was there for more than 3 million known years of history, and with settlements 
 of mankind more than 50000 years. Also around 500 BC years, there were large civilizations in Dry Zone Sri Lanka. Those people had been used 
 the ecosystems in a sustainable manner for millennia. The policy makers (especially in several government departments and authorities) should 
 at least understand that first we have to protect the people who live in and love forest. Because those forest-associated people are familiar 
 with the forest with their birth and it is their livelihood. People, who born in cities and draft documents sitting on an AC rooms, perhaps 
 like us, cannot “truly” understand the long lasting bound of countrymen to the nature with their livelihood. We cannot sustain the 
 sustainability, without letting the people who “truly” live and love forest to use the forest and its contents. We only know the sustainability 
 by theories. Nevertheless, they traditionally knew and practiced it for millennia by birth.  
</p>

   <p>
    So avoiding forest-associated communities’ access to the forest is not an intellectual approach for conservation. Intervention of some 
    unnecessary practices, as does by some government authorities, accomplished as conservation strategies is a total befuddlement. Such 
    practices have despondently caused for the degrading of traditional knowledge, extinction of large number of Sri Lankan crop varieties 
    and mainly burst out the strong bound of Sinhalese people with nature. The corollary is only conflicts. The entire system will collapse. 
    However, most of us unaware that the “human need forest - the forest need human”.
   </p>

    <p>
      Although, most of present (modern?) people have not certainly understand this serious situation since they are blind with some modern 
      economic oriented methods for conservation. Especially, those troubles have been destroyed the Sri Lankan culture and its values 
      ruthlessly, and preceded genocide. With the primary definition of the economics (The condition of a region or group as regards material 
      prosperity), short-term economic goals of few corporate have pulled the community to destroy the forest and the most of people who really
       cared for the forest are sweep out from the society. Present geopolitics and international influence on the island have been created many 
       barriers for the sustainability of the country. Our natural resources are vanishing to fulfill their wicked purpose, which was precisely 
       initiated with the colonial invasion of Portuguese, Dutch and especially British savage; this screed has to be discussed for hundreds of 
       pages.
    </p>

       <p>
        Conservation should be a dynamic process. We must use the environment while conserving it. We cannot keep restrictions like this belongs to this government department or that belongs to that authority. Further, we cannot conserve anything by making huge fences around the forest and making it is inaccessible to both man and animal. The mother earth made us all to live together. Everything made by the Mother Earth is connected with each other; dew drops or water, sand or soil, trees or animals, human or air we cannot separate anything from the system.  All of them were born by seeds sown by our mother earth. We cannot keep separately this water from the soil, or forest from animal and human.
       </p>

        <p>
          Some conservation practices are appropriate only for the temperate countries, or sometimes only for tropical countries. Therefore, we cannot use a mixture of that. What was the best practice is, the practice what forest-associated people accomplish. That is inherited for the particular land for years, most often not for an entire continent or entire district.
        </p>

          <p>
            The modern economy has destroyed the mentality of the original conservation from the peoples’ mind. A huge demand has grown over the natural resources such as wild meat, sand, water or timber. The gluttonous consumption of forest resources is continuously raised by the city. Consequently, most of borrowed outsiders to the forests, or sometimes people from the forest-associated community are used to exploit natural resources. Most often politics, policy makers, diplomats or administrators are purposely countenance it. Then the rules and regulations made to restrict the use of forest to the associated community, but seemingly above top head administrators violate rules covetously.
          </p>

          <p>
The term “conservation” introduced and scientifically taught for several decades in the globe. Do we find any overall success?

    <h1 style="font-family: Tahoma; font-weight: bold; font-size: large; color: #A4A617;">THREATS</h1>
    <p>The most serious threat confronted by Sri Lankan Endemic Animals (EASL) is deforestation with consequent 
      loss of natural habitats and fragmentation of home ranges. Extensive felling of forests that took place during 
      the past few hundred years would have had a tremendous impact on the endemic fauna of the country, as the 
      majority of endemic species inhabit wet and intermediate lowland and montane forests. The Wet zone of Sri 
      Lanka has the highest human population density and is being rapidly urbanized.
